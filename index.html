        I like a good quote â€”

        As shallow as some can be, I've often enjoyed the invitation to thought that they extend.

        I've been grossed out by how some abused famous words. Quotes are everywhere. Most of the time used as marketing tools or worse, twisted to bring a feeling of wisdom to a piece of content.

        Simplification is necessary and I've come to appreciate the imperfection of language, as a mere mirror of our own imperfections.

        Famous words, stuff heard on the streets, friends, family, graffitis... Rather that just hoarding them in a pinterest board, google doc or some other terrible place on the internet, I'll have them live here.

        I can't write. I tried. So I'll just add a short note to each post.

        It all goes somewhere, hopefully.
